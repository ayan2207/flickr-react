This project was bootstrapped with Facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project. It was cloned and "ejected" in-order to further customise and add the following features:

- Typescript compiling
- Redux state management
- React Router - for navigation

The skeleton project is available on my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/ayan2207/webapp_template)

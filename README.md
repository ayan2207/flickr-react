This project was bootstrapped with Facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project. It was cloned and "ejected" in-order to further customise and add the following features:

- Typescript compiling
- Redux state management
- React Router - for navigation

The skeleton project is available on my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/ayan2207/webapp_template)

**TODO:**
- [x] Use Typescript
- [x] Implement Redux
- [x] Add Image title search functionality
- [x] Add Infinite scrolling
- [x] Use SASS precompiler
- [ ] Add Offline support by saving response in Redux
- [ ] Add Search functionality for tags
- [ ] Improve look and feel
